# Firefox terminal test can read an empty visible text

- STATUS: OPEN
- PRIORITY: 120

`test/terminal-browser.mjs` failed once in Firefox (terminal-mailbox branch,
2026-10-01) because `__dolly.visibleTerminalText()` returned an empty
selection; three reruns passed. The helper (`src/browser.mjs`) reads the
screen by pushing a pointer drag and waiting for the display library's copy
sequence, so a drag that lands before a redraw, or a copy of an empty
selection, reads as "".

Done when: the cause is reproduced (for example 50 Firefox runs of the test)
and the helper or the display copy path is fixed, or the race is shown to be
elsewhere.
